# Grandstand
Service for efficiently counting views

## Design Goals

One of Ello's key features is the post view counter - the little number next to the eye icon in post tools that gives users an estimate of how many times that post has been served up to a user.

It provides a number of functions within the product itself:

- Giving users positive feedback on the work they post to Ello
- Creating a virtuous cycle of feedback in situations where comments and reposts may be disabled (mitigating the feeling of "posting into the void")
- Providing a sense of progression for users as they continue to engage on Ello and get exposure through more channels (categories, etc.)
